# Introduction/Summary

During the first half of the semester, a handful of classes will be devoted to increasing your comfort level and proficiency with using R/Rstudio. Assignments will be released during or after a “Lab/Exploration Day” (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KawpnImzubKawB5cPN-WXyKWmwjfK24sLVd_mTmG4mw/edit?usp=sharing"> syllabus </a> for reference). These assignments will be handed in:

1. an R Markdown format (.Rmd)
2. a knitted .html file

Markdown files should be submitted via Canvas by class time (1:59 PM) based on respective due dates (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KawpnImzubKawB5cPN-WXyKWmwjfK24sLVd_mTmG4mw/edit?usp=sharing"> syllabus </a> for reference).

You will use <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/"> R Markdown </a> to write up all R related assignments. This guide will go through the steps for answering and submitting class assignment questions using R Markdown.

# R Markdown

R Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring html, pdf, and Microsoft Word documents in RStudio. 

These documents will provide us an easy-to-read document to grade; more importantly, you will get to practice (1) writing scripts, (2) keeping track of the analyses you run, and (3) organizing your output in a reader-friendly manner. When you submit these documents on Canvas, <strong> do not combine them into a zipped compressed folder </strong>. They should be two separate files.

To be clear, R is a <i>programming language</i>. RStudio is an <i>application</i>. R Markdown is a <i>markup syntax</i> to convert R script and text into a pdf or html document. It allows for presentation-ready documents that show commands and results in a seamless flow. When you write R code and embed it in presentation documents created using R Markdown, you are forced to explicitly state the steps you took to do your research.
